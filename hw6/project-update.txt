We have started to benchmark the parallel version of Gradient Descent from libraries such as Tensorflow, SKLearn etc.
Also, we have implemented embarrasingly parallel versions of Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent, and now
we are looking ahead to implement other parallel algorithms or versions of Gradient Descent which solves Linear Least Squares
problem
